# Here the rule fires when x is bound to a symbol denoting some person who is the author of a formula y, when the formula makes a statement about the weather in (presumably some place) z, and x's home is z.  That is, we believe statements about the weather at a place only from people who live there.  Given the data

Bob livesIn  Boston.
Bob wrote  { Boston weather sunny }.
