# Looks like the following:

# (graph
#   (universals ?X)
#   (logImplies
#     (universals ?X)
#     (formula _:f0
#       (universals ?X)
#       (logIncludes
#         (formula _:f1 (universals ?X) (pattern :a :b _:bn0))
#         (formula _:f2 (universals ?X) (pattern :a :b ?X))
#       )
#     )
#     (formula _:f3 (universals ?X) (pattern ?X rdf:type :Result))
#   )
# )
# 
# evaluate graph => evaluate all child operators
#   evalutate log_implies => evaluate _:f0
#     evaluate _:f0 => evaluate log_includes
#       evaluate log_includes =>
#         evaluate _:f1
#         evaluate _:f2
#           bind ?X against lhs
#         evaluate _:f2 as bgp against _:f1 => true
#     evaluate _:f3
#       => iterate over solutions
